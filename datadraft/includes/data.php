Using this model, we determine ahead of time which locations, called bins, we would like to aggregate attempts into. The traditional model used seven regions: 2 corner three slots, rim, paint, non-paint 2-pt FGA, and above-the-break left / right 3PA. As of this morning, NBA stats uses a total of fifteen spatial locations.",

The Greek Freak is averaging 25.8 points on 54.4% shooting, while his supporting cast is not doing too shabby either...Middleton (19.5pts), Bledsoe (12.7pts), Brogdon (12.4pts), and Lopez (11.9pts). These guys have been so efficient, and our algorithms here at Data Draft have been in love with the Bucks! \n\n​Otherwise, look out for Jamal Murray who torched the Celtics (sending the boys from Boston into disarray) for 42 pints! Like we said last week, as the older player's bodies continue to fatigue, the data says they become less viable fantasy options. So, move your lineup towards younger athletes with fresh legs as the season moves into its final stretch before the playoffs. \n\nSports analytics site of the week: (going forward, every week the team at Data Draft will post a link to their favorite sports analytics site...) ​This week, the site is <a href=\"https://squared2020.com/\">squared2020</a> by Justin Jacobs.",

The Thunder outlasted the Jazz in double overtime, riding Paul George's hot hand (who hit the buzzer beating floater to win). This week also saw a couple breakouts from Buddy Hield (34pts) and the Bulls' young stars Zach LaVine (42pts on 59% shooting) and Lauri Markkanen (35 points on 60% shooting). Going forward, keep a fantasy eye on young players like LaVine, Markkanen, and Trae Young to keep putting up big numbers while the older players begin to rest heading into the playoffs.\n\nCheck out ​this <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/article/2019/02/25/week-was-nba-week-19-2019\">link​</a> to find more info on week 19 in the NBA.",

This has created many new types of statistics that can be analyzed on a per play basis, and helps data scientist have more data to run models on. All 30 NBA teams have an in-depth analytics department within their team who are constantly trying to find the next competitive advantage. The Rockets were infamous in developing the strategy in taking mainly 3 pointers, as per per possession, was a better shot than a long 2 pointer. As the league is slowly starting to roll out this data to the general public, Data Draft is using this opportunity to harness the information and provide better insight to the general fantasy basketball player. Our model is proven to beat that of ESPN's rankings.",
